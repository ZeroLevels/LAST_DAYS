[center][u][b]Origin[/b][/u][/center]

[b]LAST DAYS[/b] was a texture pack started by Doku (creator of the ever popular RPG pack). Doku began this pack with the essential land-scape defining textures (Dirt, Grass, Stone, water, trees, etc) but did not have time to do much more before discontinuing the pack. The concept he had, and the work he finished was to good to let die. Using Doku's visual and conceptual foundation History continued the pack, expanded it, and improved it. After History's dissapearance the pack was continued and further improved by Croco 15 and HalphPrice. Now I have chosen to keep [b]LAST DAYS[/b] updated with the help of the community and continue to improve it, just like the other texture pack owners had before.

[center][b][u]Objective[/u][/b][/center]
[left]The goal of LAST DAYS is to take doku's brilliant foundational work and bring it to its logical conclusion; a full scale, game changing, texture and sound overhaul which takes full advantage of the existing mechanics of minecraft and brings them into a post apocalyptic setting. Planned Features:[/left]
[left]1. Continuation of the custom sound track[/left]
[left]2. Mod support[/left]

[spoiler]* This version of the pack may have a few (1 or 2) item placeholders by Glimmar and other artists. These items hopefully won't be in any future versions of the pack.

[left][code]For the sketchy factor of a revival pack, we are going to assume that both a: The creator, History, has abandoned the project or has no time for it. And b: If history comes back he has full rights to this pack and can take back everything created to be used in the original.[/code] -That's old. I doubt history'll be back.[/left]
